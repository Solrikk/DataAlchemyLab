# DataLab 📊

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
**DataLab** is a powerful tool for processing data in various formats (**CSV**, **Excel**, **XML**, **SQL**). The project's goal is to provide convenient and efficient ways to load, process, and export data for analysts, developers, and anyone working with databases.

I have compiled various applications and scripts in Python, C#, and Go that use technologies such as:

### Python 🐍:
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for working with large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a collection of mathematical functions.
- **Openpyxl**: A library for reading and writing Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python.

### Go 🚀:
- **Golang Excelize**: A library for reading and writing Excel (XLSX) files.
- **Golang CSV**: The built-in `encoding/csv` package for working with CSV files.
- **GORM**: An excellent ORM library for Golang that simplifies interaction with databases.

### C# 💻:
- **EPPlus**: A library for reading and writing Excel 2007+ (XLSX) files.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM for C# that provides a high-level API for working with databases.
- **CsvHelper**: A library for reading and writing CSV files.

### Web Scraping 🌐:
- **BeautifulSoup** (Python): A library for parsing HTML and XML documents, and extracting data from them.
- **Scrapy** (Python): An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python.
- **HtmlAgilityPack** (C#): A library for parsing HTML in a .NET application.
- **GoQuery** (Go): A library that brings a syntax and feature set inspired by jQuery to Go for HTML parsing and web scraping.

### Cryptography 🔒:
- **PyCryptodome** (Python): A self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives.
- **BouncyCastle** (C#): A library offering cryptographic APIs that can be used to perform cryptographic computations.
- **GoCrypto** (Go): The standard `crypto` package in Go provides cryptographic functionalities.

DataLab is designed as a comprehensive solution for all your data processing needs, bringing together the power of these technologies to offer a robust and flexible toolset.
